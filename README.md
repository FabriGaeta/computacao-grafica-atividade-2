# CG - Activity 2

This activity aims to manipulate colors of a wolf, and a 3D viewer of them using OpenGL. The code was made using the ABCg library, with OpenGL, the menu, and the buttons on each board were made with ImGui and the lines and columns, in addition to the end-of-game trace, were made with Open graphics.
